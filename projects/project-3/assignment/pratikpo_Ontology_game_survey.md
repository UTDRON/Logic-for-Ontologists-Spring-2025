Particular Universes Playtest Session 1 (Not played but witnessed the recorded video)

1. Are the provided rules and explanation sufficient? What’s missing?
Rules are fundamentally sufficient however we saw many cases of arguments that is philosophically undecidable. A voting should be part of the rules(which was used in the game I witnessed). 

2. Are there sufficient cards in the deck? Or too many?
Doesn't apply to me. I watched the recorded game so I don't know how many cards were there in total. But seeing over 10 people having 7 cards each means it was sufficient for a 2.5 hour long game.
But it is still debatable, how long should this game last. And how long should argumemnt on a placement should be- should there be a max time limit on arguments?

4. Should there be more cards of any particular kind in the deck (e.g., occurrent, object, generically dependent continuant cards)?
 Can't say

5. What other text or picture cards could extend the existing themes (cat, dog, box, space)?
Space and time related cards would generate some more heated arguments.

6. Do players win too quickly, or does it take too long to win?
This game involves a lot of discussion and arguments, so I doubt there is ever a "quick win". The game I witnessed lasted for 2.5 hours to have a winner.

7. If there were spectators, did they engage or join?
I am a spectator who watched the recorded video as part of my course requirements, and I engaged with my arguments documented in a report to the instructor. 

8. What additional cards could be added to enhance the “quality” theme?
Can't answer.
"What is "quality" theme?"

Playing only one card per turn, unless there is a super card that allows more than one card in a turn.

Probably yes

7. Suggestions for understandability?
Nothing that comes to my mind right away.

I think it is necessary. I can tell as someone who has a little/no prior formal ontology education, some concepts at the top of hierarchy felt abstract to me.  But the game is a great learning tool (by listening to discussions and arguments).

Yes. However a brief explanation of BFO concepts might be useful.

Gameplay and reading and lecture.
